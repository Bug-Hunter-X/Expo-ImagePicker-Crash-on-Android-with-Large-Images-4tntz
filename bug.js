This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library and selecting an image from the device's gallery.  After selecting the image, the application crashes without providing a clear error message. This is particularly difficult to debug because the standard error logging doesn't provide sufficient information.  The crash seems to be related to memory management or how the selected image data is handled within the Expo ImagePicker component, but the exact cause remains elusive.
